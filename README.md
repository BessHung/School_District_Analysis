# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze student funding and standardized test scores and showcase school performance for the school board in making decision on school budget and priorities. 
However, the school board has notified that the file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. Specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Therefore, the report needs to be modified by replacing those data with “NaN” and recreate the following metrics:

-	The district summary
-	The school summary
-	Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
-	The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
-	The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
-	School performance based on the budget per student
-	School performance based on the school size 
-	School performance based on the type of school

## Results
Due to the academic dishonesty issue, all the ninth-grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School have been replaced by “NAN”.  Thus, the data for reviewing school performance have been recalculated. Comparing with the original results, here are the effects of the new analysis.

- #### District summary
There is total 491 number of students in 9th grade at Thomas High School, which is 1.25% of entire data. After excluding those data, as we can see from the screenshots, the average math and reading score are almost the same, and the “% Passing Math”, “% Passing Reading” and “% Overall Passing” are drop around 0.1% to 0.3%.
